<Steps>
    <Step icon="arrow-progress" title="10.2024 - Expense Workflow Enhancements">
        Enhancements will include new options for setting authorization limits per employee and forming teams responsible for specific cost centers. The interface for cost centers, projects, and sales categories will be updated to improve functionality and usability, preparing these sections for future features. Additionally, there will be more flexibility in mapping cost centers to specific ledger accounts, further personalizing the expense workflow process.
    </Step>
    <Step icon="building-columns" title="Q4 2024 - Open Banking - Renumerations">
        This integration will enable clients to connect directly to their banks, authorizing the automatic retrieval of transaction data to facilitate accurate transaction reconciliation. It will also provide a simplified method to access MT940 formatted transaction reports, reducing the manual data input required from accounting clients each month.
        Next steps include the development of a new module to manage renumeration data, which will be tightly coupled with the data we process today.
    </Step>
    <Step icon="tune" title="Q4 2024 - Advanced Auto-Configuration Process">
        We will introduce a new auto-configuration process that will automatically adjust the company context to the client's needs, depending on selected options and preferences. This process will include both module configuration and the creation of appropriate ledger accounts, cost categories, and other settings to ensure clients can quickly and easily start using the application.
    </Step>
    <Step icon="comments" title="Q1 2025 - Global Communication HUB">
        The Messaging module will receive a big overhaul and will be converted into a Global Communication HUB, offering enhanced search capabilities across all topics and a unified view of messages across multiple company contexts.
        We will also introduce new support contact methods, divided into IT Support (for bug reporting and direct in-app communication) and Altera Accounting Clients operational support, accessible from various sources including in-app and email.
        Current bug reporting and feature request forms will be replaced with a new in-app feedback tool, allowing users to submit and follow their feedback tickets directly from the application.
