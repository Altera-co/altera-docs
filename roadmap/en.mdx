<Steps>
    <Step icon="wand-sparkles" title="Q2 2025 - Automatic Data Categorization in the System">
        Invoices entered into the system will be automatically described based on your categories. Focus on your business, and we will take care of the rest.
    </Step>
    <Step icon="truck-fast" title="Q3 2024 - Advanced Auto-Configuration Process">
        We will introduce a new auto-configuration process that will automatically adjust the company context to the client's needs, depending on selected options and preferences. This process will include both module configuration and the creation of appropriate ledger accounts, cost categories, and other settings to ensure clients can quickly and easily start using the application.
    </Step>
    <Step icon="building-columns" title="Q3 2025 - Remuneration Module">
        An interactive module that, in collaboration with our AI and Machine Learning solutions, will allow for easy and effective data integration from various sources, including banks, suppliers, and clients, to automate remuneration processes. Data collected in the Remuneration module will allow for detailed company performance analysis, verification of our contractors, and quick and effective business decision-making.
    </Step>
    <Step icon="users" title="Q3 2025 - Contractors 2.0">
        We are expanding the Contractors module with useful statistical data and security features (such as recording authorized bank accounts) to increase security and ease of use of the application.
    </Step>
    <Step icon="comments" title="Q4 2025 - KSEF">
        Following the official announcement on 30.06.2025 by the Ministry of Finance regarding the mandatory implementation of the National e-Invoice System (KSEF) for all VAT taxpayers and the official publication of the KSEF technical specification, we plan to introduce integration with the National e-Invoice System as soon as the official test environment is opened.
        As part of this integration, the Sales module will be enhanced with features enabling the generation of e-invoices compliant with KSEF requirements, as well as automatic sending and receiving of invoices to/from the Ministry of Finance system.
        The Costs module will also be updated to support users in this new reality, giving them confidence and security in operating within a fully digital document workflow.
        E-invoices originating from KSEF will be clearly marked in the system, requiring appropriate substantive verification ("is this really my invoice?") and taking necessary actions to secure the company against irregularities and fraud.
    </Step>
    <Step icon="comments" title="Q4 2025 - Global Communication HUB">
        The Messaging module will receive a big overhaul and will be converted into a Global Communication HUB, offering enhanced search capabilities across all topics and a unified view of messages across multiple company contexts.
        We will also introduce new support contact methods, divided into IT Support (for bug reporting and direct in-app communication) and Altera Accounting Clients operational support, accessible from various sources including in-app and email.
        Current bug reporting and feature request forms will be replaced with a new in-app feedback tool, allowing users to submit and follow their feedback tickets directly from the application.
    </Step>
    <Step icon="address-card" title="Q4 2025 - HR Module">
        A new HR module that will allow for managing employee data, including their contracts, salaries, leaves, training, and other information. The module will also include tools for analyzing HR data, reminders of upcoming obligations, contract ends, or necessary medical examinations.
    </Step>
    <Step icon="magnifying-glass-chart" title="Q1 2026 - Virtual CFO and Analytics">
        We will introduce a new Virtual CFO module, significantly expanding the current Finance module. The new module will allow for financial data analysis and report generation, including financial forecasts, profitability analysis, cost and revenue analysis, and other managerial reports. This module will also include financial data analysis tools such as trend analysis, comparative analysis, sensitivity analysis, and others to help clients make business decisions.
